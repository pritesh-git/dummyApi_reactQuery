# Dummy API App: A Redux Practice Project

## Overview

This is a Redux project aimed at practicing fundamental concepts such as setting up Redux, managing global state, handling asynchronous actions, and integrating Redux with React. The application simulates interactions with a dummy API to fetch and display data.

### Learning Objectives:

- Set up Redux in a React application
- Define Redux actions, reducers, and store
- Manage global state with Redux
- Handle asynchronous actions using Redux Thunk middleware
- Integrate Redux with React components for data fetching and state management

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pritesh-git/dummy-api-app.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd dummy-api-app
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application:

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start  # or yarn start
   ```
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Customization and Further Development:

Feel free to experiment with the codebase, explore new functionalities, or add features to the dummy API application. You could enhance it by adding pagination, implementing search functionality, or integrating with a real API.
